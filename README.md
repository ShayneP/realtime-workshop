# Realtime Workshop Files

Thanks for attending the workshop!

Here is the agent file that we worked on during the demo:

### Agent.py
This is our agent code, that you can run with `python agent.py dev`. Remember, when you're running in dev mode, all changes will immediately be synced to your running agent!

The changes from the workshop where we added function calling and customized system prompts are both already added in this example.

### Workshop.pdf

This is where I put the slides from the demo, peruse at your leisure!
