# Realtime Workshop Files

Thanks for attending the workshop!

Here are the files that we worked on during the demo:

### Agent.py
This is our agent code, that you can run with `python agent.py dev`. Remember, when you're running in dev mode, all changes will immediately be synced to your running agent!

The changes from the workshop where we added function calling and customized system prompts are both already added in this example.

## Frontend
This directory includes the visualizer frontend demo that you can use to interact with your demo. This is a the local version of the sandbox that's available in your cloud dashboard!

### Workshop.pdf

This is where I put the slides from the demo, peruse at your leisure!
